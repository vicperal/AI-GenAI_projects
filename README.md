# AI-GenAI_projects
Python projects, where I used modules such as Plotly, scikit-learn, Flask, JSON, Pandas, Numpy, etc. to analyze the relationship between data from databases and calculate predictions using models such as linear regression, assembly methods, etc. It display the graphs in a Web app created in Flask

multi-ML_comparison_Flask_frontend.py is a multi-ML choice Flask application, it uses of http://api.worldbank.org public data for model training
Server and Frontend code: index.html is generated to plot the 3d graph with real and predicted values. It also compares the predicted model performance
